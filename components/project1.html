        <h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
        <p>In a team of four, we analyzed several factors to determine their relation to housing in the United States during the 20-year period of 2004 to 2023.
        These factors included: household income, population growth, interest rates, building permits, unemployment, and education.
        We found some of these factors are correlated while others are not.
        We also identified several trends in housing, such as declining home affordability and fluctuations due to the 2008 housing crisis
        as well as COVID in 2020.</p>
        <h3><u>Methodology</u></h3>
        <p>This project used Python (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Geopandas) to read data from CSV files, conduct statistical analyses, and produce visualizations.
        Data was retrieved from <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">FRED</a> using their API.

                <p>The change in median home values from 2004 to 2023 shows a great disparity between the top and bottom five states. The least-expensive
                    states are closely clustered in value, with little fluctuation over this 20-year-period. The five most-expensive states, however,
                    show much greater volatility and wider differences in values in any given year. California, for example, experienced a peak in 2006,
                    followed by a trough that it didn't recover from until 2018.

                <p>These graphs plot linear regression between median home values and median incomes for 2004 and 2023. While there is only a moderate
                    linear relationship (R<sup>2</sup>=0.56 in 2004 and R<sup>2</sup>=0.46 in 2023), the more important point is that this relationship
                    actually <i>decreased</i>, meaning median income became <i>less</i> reliable as a predictor of home values. This is concerning,
                    as for most homebuyers income is the primary avenue for home acquisition. When it is less dependable for pricing a home, homebuyers
                    may face additional difficulties as they have fewer other assets to leverage for the purchase.

                <p>Home affordability is the ratio of income to home value, and here we see a comparison of the top and bottom five states for 2004 and 2023.
                    2004 is unsurprising: the most affordable states are predominantly rural, while the least affordable are notably urbanized, with the
                    exception of Hawaii (which is expected to be less affordable by its nature of a remote tropical island paradise). Comparing to 2023, we
                    see a few important changes. First, affordability decreased across the board, even among the most affordable states. Second, Illinois
                    became the fifth most affordable state. This is interesting because, while Illinois does have considerable farmland, it is also home to
                    Chicago, the third most populous city in the country; one would expect that would put it toward the other end of the scale. Next, while Hawaii
                    overtook California as the least affordable state, California's affordability still decreased; Hawaii's just decreased by a greater margin.
                    Lastly, and perhaps most surprising, Idaho became the third least affordable state, suggesting a housing crisis in the rural state.

                <p>This map shows the percentage change in home affordability between 2004 and 2023. It has three noteworthy aspects. First, the map largely trends
                    toward red, corrobroating the previous point that in most states affordability decreased. Second, of the few states in green, Illinois shows the
                    greatest <i>increase</i> in affordability, explaining its showing as the fifth most affordable state in 2023. Lastly, Idaho clearly has the largest
                    <i>decrease</i> at around 50%, reflecting a potential affordability disaster there.

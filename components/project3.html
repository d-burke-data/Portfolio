        <h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
        <p>In a team of four, we created an interactive web application dashboard is based on nearly 80,000 tornado event records in the U.S. from 1950-2024.</p>
        <p>The dashboard is live, and you can explore it here: <a href="https://d-burke-data.github.io/Project_03/">https://d-burke-data.github.io/Project_03/</a>.</p>
        <h3><u>Features</u></h3>
        <p>Interactive dashboard web app with dropdown options to filter data by time (required), location, & EF-scale. The following visualizations are generated by data from API calls based on user-inputs:<br>
            <h5>Leaflet Map</h5>
            <p>The primary feature of the dashboard, the map comes with three overlay options:
                <div class="col">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Counties: combines data retrieved through our API with GeoJSON to generate a colored overlay based on the number of events per county.</li>
                        <li>Events: utilizes individual event data to plot begin and end points of each event to showcase its path. Clicking on an event begin or end
                            point provides detailed information in a popup.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Triangle: begin point of tornado event.</li>
                            <li>Square: end point of tornado event (only visible when zooming into map).</li>
                            <li>Path: arrows pointing in the direction of the tornado's path. The longer the path, the larger the arrows.</li>
                            <li>Marker color: based on EF-scale.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Heatmap: based on the begin point location for each event.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> This zoomed in map with Events layer over Counties layer clearly shows tornado events crossing county borders and even changing EF-scale rating.
            </p>
            <div class="row">                
                <img class="img-viz" src="images/project-03/tornado-map.png" alt="Event map with Events layer over Counties layer showing tornado events crossing county borders with changing EF-scale ratings." width="1649" height="736">
            </div>
            <h5>Plotly Charts</h5>
            <div class="col">
                <ul>
                    <li>Pie chart: displays percentages of events categorized by their EF-scale ranking.</li>
                    <li>Bar chart: displays totals by month with options to see total events, deaths, injuries, property damage, or crop damage per month.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h5>Summary Tables</h5>
            <div class="col">
                <ul>
                    <li>Duration: shows total time of tornado events during period and average tornado lifespan.</li>
                    <li>Totals: shows overall totals for events, deaths, injuries and damages costs (property and crop).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Again, the dashboard is available to use here: <a href="https://d-burke-data.github.io/Project_03/">https://d-burke-data.github.io/Project_03/</a>.</p>
